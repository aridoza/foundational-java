## Introduction (5 min)

If you've worked with Java long enough, you've eventually come across the dreaded `NullPointerException`. There's nothing worse than having your code completely stop execution because you expect a variable to contain a value when none is actually present. To circumvent this, Java 8 released the optional class.  

**What Is an Optional?**

The **optional class** is a single-value container that may or may not contain a value. Being structured as such, it forces the developer to think about how to handle the situation when a value is not present, and it reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to test for null values.

-----

## How to Create Optionals (5 min)

The optional class has three static methods for creation:

* `.empty()` 
* `.of()`
* `.ofNullable()`

To create an empty optional (i.e., one that contains no value), you can do the following:

```java
Optional<String> emptyOptional = Optional.empty();
System.out.println(emptyOptional.isPresent());
```

Output: 
    `false`

The `isPresent()` method is used to check if a value exists. We'll cover it more in the next section.

You can also create an optional from an existing value by using the `.of()` method:

```java
String name = "Mark";
Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.of(name);
System.out.println(optionalName.isPresent());
System.out.println(optionalName.get());

```

Output:  
  
   `true
   Mark`

The output shows that the value of `Mark` is present in the optional. But, what happens if a null value is passed to the `.of()` method? Let's see:

```java
String nullValue = null;
Optional.of(nullValue);
```

Output:  
    Exception in thread "main" `java.lang.NullPointerException`

We got the dreaded `NullPointerException`. This leads us to the last static method of the optional class, `.ofNullable()`:

```java
String stringValue = "myString";
Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.ofNullable(stringValue);
System.out.println(optionalValue.isPresent());
```

Output:  
    `false`

As you can see, we didn't get a `NullPointerException`. Instead, we have an empty optional. With that said, the preferred static method to use when creating an optional class with a value that could be null would be `.ofNullable()`.

-----

## Checking for Values in Optionals (15 min)

The optional class provides three useful methods for checking the state of an optional: 

- `isPresent()`: Returns `true` if the optional has a value present.
- `isEmpty()`: Returns `true` if the optional does not have a value (this is available starting with Java 11).
- `ifPresent()`: A functional style replacement; checks if a value is empty, then accepts a lambda representing a consumer instance.

Let's take a look at a demo to see how we'd use these methods.

### Demo

You've seen the `isPresent()` method in the previous demo:

```java
String name = "Mark";
Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.of(name);
System.out.println(optionalName.isPresent());
```

Output:  
    `true`

The `ifPresent()` is a functional style way of wrapping a null check around logic. 

Let's examine the following non-optional way of checking for null:

```java
Integer age = 20;
if(age != null) {
    System.out.println("My age is " + age);
}
```

Output:  
    `My age is 20`

This can be rewritten using the `ifPresent()` method:

```java
Optional<Integer> ageOptional = Optional.ofNullable(age);
ageOptional.ifPresent(myAge -> System.out.println("My age is " + myAge));
```

Output:  
    `My age is 20`

Looking at the example, the `ifPresent()` method uses a lambda expression to represent a consumer function. If you remember from the last module, a consumer accepts one input and returns `void`. By using `ifPresent()`, it removes the need for the boilerplate `if(age != null)` check.

Starting with Java 11, the optional class now has an `isEmpty()` method that does the opposite of the `isPresent()` method:

```java
Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(optionalValue.isEmpty());
```

Output:  
    `true`

-----

## Getting Optional Values (20 min)

The optional class provides a `get()` method for getting the value in the optional. It also provides some `orElse`-type methods to help in cases where a value is not present in the optional:

- `get()`: Gets the value from the optional.
- `orElse()`: Provides a default value if the optional is empty.
- `orElseGet()`: Provides a default value via a supplier functional interface if the optional is empty.
- `orElseThrow()`: Provides a supplier functional interface to return an exception if the optional is empty.

Let's take a look at some examples.

### Demo

The first example shows how to use the `get()` method:

```java
Optional<String> nameOptional = Optional.ofNullable("Amanda");
System.out.println(nameOptional.get());
```

Output:  
    `Amanda`

The output is as expected. But, what if the optional has no value? Let's look at an example:

```java
Optional<String> nameOptional = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(nameOptional.get());
```

Output:  
    Exception in thread "main" `java.util.NoSuchElementException`: No value present

You get an exception. This is where the `orElse()` methods come to the rescue!

To demonstrate the `orElse()` methods, let's assume we have the following:

```java
public static String getDefaultName() {
    System.out.println("In getDefaultName method");
    return "World";
}
```

We would use the `orElse()` method as follows:

```java
String nullValue = null;
String orElseName = Optional.ofNullable(nullValue).orElse(getDefaultName());
System.out.println(orElseName);
```

Output:  
    `World`

Because the optional is empty, the `orElse()` is triggered.

Now let's see an example of the `orElseGet()` method:

```java
String nullValue = null;
String orElseGetName = Optional.ofNullable(nullValue).orElseGet(() -> getDefaultName());
System.out.println(orElseGetName);

```
Output:  
   `World`

On the surface, it appears that both `orElse()` and `orElseGet()` do the same thing, but there's a subtle difference between the two that could mean a big deal in terms of performance. Let's take a look.

Using the same method as before:

```java
public static String getDefaultName() {
    System.out.println("In getDefaultName method");
    return "World";
}
```

This time, let's run the same code as before but populate the optional with a value:

```java
System.out.println("orElse with populated Optional");
String orElseSideEffect = Optional.ofNullable("John").orElse(getDefaultName());
System.out.println(orElseSideEffect);
```

> **Knowledge Check**: Before we look at the output, what do you expect to see? If you expect that the `getDefaultName()` method will NOT be called, you are 100% wrong. Whoops!

Let's examine the output:

    orElse with populated Optional  
    In getDefaultName method  
    John  

This can be a big deal if the `getDefaultName()`method has to do something slow, such as hitting a database. This results in unnecessary executions.  

Now let's look at an example using `orElseGet()`:

```java
System.out.println("orElseGet with populated Optional");
String orElseGetName2 = Optional.ofNullable("John").orElseGet(() -> getDefaultName());
System.out.println(orElseGetName);
```

Output:  
    `orElseGet with populated optional  
    World`  

As you can see, the `getDefaultName()` method is not triggered as expected. This is because the supplier lambda is using lazy evaluation. The lambda is supplied, but because it is not needed, it is never executed, so it doesn't trigger the `getDefaultName()` method. With that said, the preferred way to provide a default value is generally going to be `orElseGet()`.

Now, let's take a look at an example of `orElseThrow()`:

```java
String name = Optional.ofNullable(nullValue).orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("Name is missing"));
```

Output:  
    Exception in thread "main" `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`: Name is missing

As you can see, an exception is thrown if the optional is empty.

------

## How `map()`, `flatMap()`, and `filter()` Work with Optionals (20 min)

The optional class provides three useful stream-like operation methods for manipulating optionals:

- `filter()`: Runs a test on the optional value based on a given predicate. If the predicate returns `true`, the optional is returned as-is. If the predicate returns `false`, then an empty optional is returned.
- `map()`: Runs a computation on the optional's unwrapped value and wraps the result of the computation in a new optional before returning.
- `flatMap()`: Similar to the `map()` method, except that, where `map()` operates on an optional containing an arbitrary value, `flatMap()` assumes the value itself is an optional and will first unwrap that optional value before performing the computation. This is useful in processing `Stream`s of optionals. You want to unwrap those optionals before processing, so you use `flatMap()`. 

These definitions may be a lot to digest, so let's take a look at some examples to help clear things up.

### Demo

First, let's take a look at `filter()`:

```java
Optional<Integer> ageOptional = Optional.ofNullable(25);
boolean canBuyAlcohol = ageOptional.filter(age -> age >= 21).isPresent();
System.out.println(canBuyAlcohol);
```

Output:  
    `true`

As we mentioned earlier in the `filter()` definition, if the predicate returns `true`, then the optional is returned as-is. So in this case, the `isPresent()` method returns `true`.

Let's take a look at the opposite scenario, in which the age is under 21:

```java
ageOptional = Optional.ofNullable(20);
canBuyAlcohol = ageOptional.filter(age -> age >= 21).isPresent();
System.out.println(canBuyAlcohol);
```

Output:  
    `false`

The `filter()` method returns an empty optional, which causes the `isPresent()` method to return `false`.

Let's take a look at the `map()` method. Let's say we have the following `Person` class:

```java
public static class Person {

    private int age;

    public Person(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

We're going to run the same logic as before, where we check the person's age to see if they are old enough to buy alcohol. But this time, we'll use the `map()` method:

```java
Person person = new Person(25);
boolean canAlsoBuyAlchohol = Optional.ofNullable(person)
        .map(Person::getAge)
        .filter(age -> age >= 21)
        .isPresent();
System.out.println(canAlsoBuyAlchohol);
```

Output:  
    `true`  

There's a lot going on here, so let's dissect: 

1. The `map()` method runs a computation on an optional's unwrapped value and returns an optional containing the result. 
1. The `map()` method accesses the `Optional<Person>`'s unwrapped `age` value (in this example). 
1. The `filter()` method then receives an `Optional<Integer>` representing the age of 25. 
1. The `filter()` predicate is `true`, so it returns the `Optional<Integer>` as-is to the `isPresent()` method.

Now let's look at a `flatMap()` example that follows the same logic and talk through its details. Let's assume we have the following `Person` class:

```java
public static class PersonWithOptional {

    private Optional<Integer> age;

    public PersonWithOptional(Integer age) {
        this.age = Optional.ofNullable(age);
    }

    public Optional<Integer> getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(Optional<Integer> age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

To run the same logic as before with `flatMap()`, we'd do the following:  

```java
PersonWithOptional personWithOptional = new PersonWithOptional(25);
boolean ableToBuyAlcohol = Optional.ofNullable(personWithOptional)
        .flatMap(PersonWithOptional::getAge)
        .filter(age -> age >= 21)
        .isPresent();
System.out.println(ableToBuyAlcohol);
```

Output:  
    `true`  

Let's first examine the `PersonWithOptional` class. The member variable `age` is an `Optional<Integer>`. In other words, `age` is wrapped in an optional. Looking at the `flatMap()` definition, `flatMap()` will first unwrap the value from the optional before performing its computation.  

Looking at the `flatMap()` line in the example, it's accessing the `Optional<PersonWithOptional>`'s unwrapped `age` value just as the `map()` method does. The difference is that `flatMap()` expects this optional to contain another optional and will unwrap that extra later. Had we used `map()`, the return from `map()` would have been `Optional<Optional<Integer>>`.

## Independent Practice (15 min)

For independent practice, we'll take the following template program below and complete the "TODO" portions in the comments. To confirm that your results are correct, iterate each list that you create and output the results.  

**Hint:**  
- You'll need to use `ofNullable()`.
- You'll need to leverage the `flatMap()` and `filter()` methods.
- You'll also need to use `orElseGet()`.

### Independent Practice Template

        private Television(String skuId, boolean hdmiEnabled, boolean fourKEnabled, Integer price) {
            this.skuId = Optional.ofNullable(skuId);
            this.hdmiEnabled = Optional.ofNullable(hdmiEnabled);
            this.fourKEnabled = Optional.ofNullable(fourKEnabled);
