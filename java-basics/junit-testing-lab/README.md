## Introduction

Using the code from a previous lab - where we wrote several basic functions - you are going to write tests (that pass) for the code. Here's a refresher of the functions you wrote:

- Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. I would suggest using conditional statements. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.

- Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

- Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

- Write a function that return the number of arguments passed to the function when called.

- Define a function `reverseString` that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".

**Bonus**

- Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.

- Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and a number `i` and returns the array of words that are longer than i characters long.

## Exercise

Start the code you already created in [this lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/GA-Cognizant/foundational-java/tree/master/java-basics/functions-lab). Write tests using jUnit to ensure each function is correct.
