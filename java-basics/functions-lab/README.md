## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

This lab provides an opportunity to practice creating functions.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Write code that implements various functions, following the requirements in the list below:

- Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. I would suggest using conditional statements. Do a Google search to figure this out if you forgot how conditionals work.

- Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

- Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e., a string of length 1) and returns true if it's a vowel, false otherwise.

- Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.

- Define a function `reverseString` that computes the reversal of a string. For example, `reverseString("jag testar")` should return the string "ratset gaj".

**Bonus**

- Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.

- Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and a number `i` and returns the word(s) in the array longer than `i` characters long.

- Create a `Car` class with the following member variables: `mTopSpeed` and `mNumberOfDoors`. In that class, write a constructor method that assigns random values to the member variables. Also, write a method that prints out the line "Your car has a top speed of ___ mph, and for some reason has ____ doors."

#### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this lab.

#### Deliverable

You'll review the answers with the instructor in class.
