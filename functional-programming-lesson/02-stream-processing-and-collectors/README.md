## Opening - Recap of Streams and Pipelines  
To recap, in the previous lesson we learned that:
- a stream is a sequence of elements that carries values from a source through a pipeline via lambda expressions 
- We learned that a pipeline is a sequence of stream operations, such as filtering and aggregation operations.
- We learned the difference between intermediate and terminal stream operations

In this lesson we will go in more detail about how to create streams, the different intermediate and terminal stream operations, and collectors.  

The first demo will show you the different ways that you can create a Stream.

## Demo - Different Ways to Create Streams
In our lessons thus far, you've seen one way to create a stream via a collection.

    List<String> stringList = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
    Stream stringStream = stringList.stream();
    stringStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

You can create a stream from an array:

    Integer[] intArray = new Integer[]{1,2,3,4};
    Stream intArrayStream = Stream.of(intArray);
    intArrayStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

You can create a stream from individual objects:

    Stream objectStream = Stream.of(100,200,300);
    objectStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));

You can create streams by leveraging the Stream Builder:

    Stream.Builder<String> stringStreamBuilder = Stream.builder();

    stringStreamBuilder.accept("I really love ");
    stringStreamBuilder.accept("streams and ");
    stringStreamBuilder.accept("lambda expressions!!! ");

    Stream stringBuilderStream = stringStreamBuilder.build();
    stringBuilderStream.forEach(value -> System.out.println(value));


## Introduction - Intermediate Stream Operations  
In the previous lesson we learned that stream operations are used to modify streams to create an end result. We also learned that intermediate stream operations take a stream as input, modifies the stream, and outputs a result stream. In this section, we will discuss some of the commonly used intermediate stream operations.  

The key takeaways that you should have about intermediate stream operations after this section should be:  
- **Intermediate stream operations do not produce an end result. They use lazy evaluation, meaning stream processing does not activate until a terminal stream operation is specified.**
- **The order of your stream operations matter.  Not ordering them correctly could have performance impacts.**

## Demo - Intermediate Stream Operations  
In this demo will first take a look at some of the commonly used intermediate stream operations.  After that we will see that no processing happens until a terminal operation occurs. Lastly, we will look at what happens when you don't order your intermediate operations correctly.

### Commonly Used Intermediate Stream Operations

**Filter: selects elements based on a condition you provide **  
    
    //Filter - Get numbers greater than 50
    List<Integer> numberList = Arrays.asList(1,2,50,100);
    List<Integer> filteredNumberList =
            numberList.stream()
            .filter(number -> number > 50)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    filteredNumberList.stream().forEach(number -> System.out.println(number));
    
Outputs:  
100

For the next demo examples, assume we have the following Person class:

    public class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }
    }


**Map: is used to transform one object into a different object by using a lambda expression**  

    //Map - Take the Person list and create a list of their ages.
    List<Person> personList =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new Person("Tom", 30),
                    new Person("Jane", 45),
                    new Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<Integer> ageList =
            personList.stream()
            .map(person -> person.getAge())
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    ageList.stream().forEach(age -> System.out.println(age));


Output is:  
30  
45  
70  

**Flatmap: is used to flatten data structures such as collections to help with stream operations**  
The following example will flatten a list of person lists, List<List<Person>>, into just a list of persons, List<Person>.  

    //FlatMap - flatten the list of person lists
    List<Person> personList1 =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new Person("Tom", 30),
                    new Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<Person> personList2 =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new Person("Jane", 45));

    List<List<Person>> listOfPersonLists = Arrays.asList(personList1, personList2);

    List<Person> flatPersonList =
            listOfPersonLists.stream()
                .flatMap(Collection::stream)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    flatPersonList.stream().forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output is:  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  

The Collection:stream line basically says take the list streams from both lists and merge them.  

  
**Sorted: is used to sort elements in a stream based on a given comparator**  
The following example will sort the list of persons by name. 

    //Sorted - Sort the person list by name alphabetically
    List<Person> sortedList =
            personList.stream()
            .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    sortedList.stream().forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output is:  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  

###Stream Processing Doesn't Start Until We Have A Terminal Stream Operation  
We mentioned earlier that stream processing doesn't start until a terminal stream operation is encountered, due to lazy evaluation.  See the example below:

    personList.stream()
        .filter(person -> {
            System.out.println("Person is: " + person);
            return person.getAge() > 30;
        });

If we tried to run the code above, there would be no output to the console. Now let's add a terminal operation and see what happens:

    personList.stream()
        .filter(person -> {
            System.out.println("Person is: " + person);
            return person.getAge() > 30;
        })
        .collect(Collectors.toList());


The output is:  
Person is: Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person is: Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person is: Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

### How Ordering is Important With Intermediate Operations   
The last example for this demo will show you how not properly ordering your intermediate operations can cause unnecessary processing.  Take a look at the following example:

    List<Person> largePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new Person("Tom", 30),
                new Person("John", 29),
                new Person("Jenny", 20),
                new Person("Mark", 35),
                new Person("Chris", 37),
                new Person("Paige", 31),
                new Person("Helen", 60),
                new Person("Erin", 50),
                new Person("Zach", 10),
                new Person("Jane", 45),
                new Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<Person> sortedAndFilteredList =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
            .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 31)
            .filter(person -> person.getName().startsWith("J"))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    sortedAndFilteredList.stream().forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output is:  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

If you notice, we do the sort first and then the filtering.  The sort has to look through all 11 Person objects.  The filter by age has to look through all 11 Person objects.  The last filter by names that start with "J" has to look through 6 Person objects due to the previous age filter.  That's 28 total iterations.  

What if we reordered the intermediate stream operations in the pipeline by putting the filters first.  Which filter should be first?  I would say to pick the filter that produces the least results.  Which filter would that be? The age filter returns 6 results, where as, the name filter returns 4.  Let's redo the example and see how many total iterations it will be after reordering.

    List<Person> filteredAndSortedList =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .filter(person -> person.getName().startsWith("J"))
            .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 31)
            .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    filteredAndSortedList.stream().forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));


Output is:  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

The first name filter takes 11 iterations to filter the stream down to 4.  The age filter takes 4 iterations to filter the stream down to 2 Person objects.  Lastly, you have the sort of those 2 Person objects in the stream.  That's a total of 17 iterations.  We've cut out 11 unnecessary iterations just by reordering the pipeline!

##Introduction - Terminal Stream Operations
In the last section we learned about intermediate stream operations and how they can be used to manipulate streams. We also learned that stream processing doesn't start until there is a terminal stream operation. We will use this section to discuss terminal stream operations. As mentioned in the last functional programming module, terminal operations, such as forEach(), mark the stream as consumed, after which point it can no longer be used further.  

Some of the commonly used terminal stream operations are:  
- forEach - used to iterate through a stream
- findFirst - returns the first entry in a stream
- collect - repackages the stream to a different data structure
- toArray - converts the stream to an array

There are other useful terminal operations that will be discussed further in the "Comparison Based Stream Operations" section.

##Demo - Terminal Stream Operations  
For this short demo, we are going to show examples of using forEach, findFirst, collect, and toArray.  We will also leverage the same Person class that was used in the previous demo.

    public class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }
    }

###forEach
Print out each person's name.

    List<TerminalOperations.Person> largePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Tom", 30),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("John", 29),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Jenny", 20),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Mark", 35),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Chris", 37),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Paige", 31),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Helen", 60),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Erin", 50),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Zach", 10),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Jane", 45),
                new TerminalOperations.Person("Jeff", 70));

    //forEach - print out each person's name
    largePersonList.stream()
        .forEach(person -> System.out.println("Hello my name is " + person.getName()));

Output:  
Hello my name is Tom  
Hello my name is John  
Hello my name is Jenny  
Hello my name is Mark  
Hello my name is Chris  
Hello my name is Paige  
Hello my name is Helen  
Hello my name is Erin  
Hello my name is Zach  
Hello my name is Jane  
Hello my name is Jeff  


###findFirst
Find the first person over the age of 35.

    Person personOverThirtyFive =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 35)
            .findFirst()
            .orElse(null);

    System.out.println(personOverThirtyFive);

Output:  
Person{name='Chris', age=37}

###collect
Find persons whose name starts with the letter "J". Notice that since the collect is a terminal operation, we can immediately call another terminal operation "forEach" to print the results.

    largePersonList.stream()
        .filter(person -> person.getName().startsWith("J"))
        .collect(Collectors.toList())
    .forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output:  
Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}

###toArray
Create an array from the largePersonList.

   Person[] personArray =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .toArray(Person[]::new);

    System.out.println(personArray[0]);
    System.out.println(personArray[1]);
    System.out.println(personArray[2]);
    System.out.println(personArray[3]);
    System.out.println(personArray[4]);
    System.out.println(personArray[5]);
    System.out.println(personArray[6]);
    System.out.println(personArray[7]);
    System.out.println(personArray[8]);
    System.out.println(personArray[9]);
    System.out.println(personArray[10]);

Output:  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='Mark', age=35}  
Person{name='Chris', age=37}  
Person{name='Paige', age=31}  
Person{name='Helen', age=60}  
Person{name='Erin', age=50}  
Person{name='Zach', age=10}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}

##Introduction - Comparison Based Stream Operations
In the past sections of this module, we discussed commonly used intermediate and terminal operations.  In this section, we will discuss useful stream operations that can be used for comparing items in a stream.  They are:

- sorted - intermediate operation that will sort a stream
- min - terminal operation that will return the minimum element based on a comparator
- max - terminal operation that will return the maximum element based on a comparator
- distinct - intermediate operation that will eliminate duplicates in a stream based on the equals() method of the stream elements
- allMatch - terminal operation that given a predicate, returns a boolean true if all elements in the stream satisfy the predicate
- anyMatch - terminal operation that given a predicate, returns a boolean true if one of elements in the stream satisfy the predicate
- noneMatch - terminal operation that given a predicate, returns a boolean true if none of the elements in the stream satisfy the predicate

The following demo will go into a little more detail of each one.

##Demo - Comparison Based Stream Operations
In this demo, we will take a look at each of the comparison based stream operations mentioned in the introduction. We will also be using the same Person class from the previous demos.

    public class Person {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name,
                      int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }

        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

        public void setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Person{" +
                    "name='" + name + '\'' +
                    ", age=" + age +
                    '}';
        }
    }

###sorted 
We saw an example of this in the intermediate stream operation section.  The following example sorts the list of persons by name.

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> largePersonList =
            Arrays.asList(
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Tom", 30),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("John", 29),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jenny", 20),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Mark", 35),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Chris", 37),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Paige", 31),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Helen", 60),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Erin", 50),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Zach", 10),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jane", 45),
                    new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jeff", 70));

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> sortedList =
            largePersonList.stream()
                    .sorted((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().compareTo(person2.getName()))
                    .collect(Collectors.toList());

    sortedList.stream().forEach(person -> System.out.println(person));

Output:  
Person{name='Chris', age=37}  
Person{name='Erin', age=50}  
Person{name='Helen', age=60}  
Person{name='Jane', age=45}  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  
Person{name='Jenny', age=20}  
Person{name='John', age=29}  
Person{name='Mark', age=35}  
Person{name='Paige', age=31}  
Person{name='Tom', age=30}  
Person{name='Zach', age=10}  

###min
This example will return the youngest person.  

    Person youngestPerson =
        largePersonList.stream()
            .min((p1, p2) -> p1.getAge() - p2.getAge())
            .orElse(null);

    System.out.println(youngestPerson);

Output:   
Person{name='Zach', age=10}  

**Note:** Some stream operations, such as min, max, findFirst, return an Optional object. This will be covered in detail in another module, but for now Optionals are used in the case where none of the stream elements satisfy the predicate.  This is where the "orElse" clause comes in the previous example.  If no, result is found, it will return null.  However, we did find a result in our example.

###max
This example will return the oldest person.

    Person oldestPerson =
            largePersonList.stream()
                    .min((p1, p2) -> p2.getAge() - p1.getAge())
                    .orElse(null);

    System.out.println(oldestPerson);

Output:  
Person{name='Jeff', age=70}  

###distinct
The following example will take a stream of integers that contain duplicates and then return it without any duplicates.

    Stream<Integer> integerStream = Stream.of(1,1,2,2,3,4,5);

    integerStream
        .distinct()
        .forEach(integer -> System.out.println(integer));

Output:  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  

###allMatch
This example will return true if all the persons are over the age of 9.

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> largePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Tom", 30),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("John", 29),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jenny", 20),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Mark", 35),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Chris", 37),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Paige", 31),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Helen", 60),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Erin", 50),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Zach", 10),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jane", 45),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jeff", 70));

    Boolean isAllOverTheAgeOfNine =
            largePersonList.stream()
                .allMatch(person -> person.getAge() > 9);

    System.out.println(isAllOverTheAgeOfNine);

Output:  
true

###anyMatch
This example will return true if any person is over the age of 50.

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> largePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Tom", 30),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("John", 29),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jenny", 20),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Mark", 35),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Chris", 37),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Paige", 31),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Helen", 60),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Erin", 50),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Zach", 10),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jane", 45),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jeff", 70));

    Boolean isAnyOverTheAgeOfFifty =
            largePersonList.stream()
                .anyMatch(person -> person.getAge() > 50);

    System.out.println(isAnyOverTheAgeOfFifty);

Output:  
true

###noneMatch
This example will return true if there is not a person over the age of 70.

    List<ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person> largePersonList =
        Arrays.asList(
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Tom", 30),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("John", 29),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jenny", 20),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Mark", 35),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Chris", 37),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Paige", 31),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Helen", 60),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Erin", 50),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Zach", 10),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jane", 45),
                new ComparisonBaseStreamOperations.Person("Jeff", 70));

    Boolean isNoneOverTheAgeOfSeventy =
            largePersonList.stream()
                .noneMatch(person -> person.getAge() > 70);

    System.out.println(isNoneOverTheAgeOfSeventy);

Output:  
true

##Introduction - More Collectors
In the previous module, we talked briefly about collectors.  In the section, we will look at other data structures that we can collect to.
