## Independent Practice
For the Independent Practice, we will take the following template program below and complete 
the "TODO" portions that are in the comments.  To confirm that your results are correct,
iterate each list that you create and output the results.  

**Hint:**  
- You'll need to leverage the intermediate operations "map" and "filter"
- You'll also need to use the terminal operation "Collectors.toList"

### Independent Practice Template

```java
```

The completed example can be found in the repo in the file named "IndependentPracticeCompleted.java".


## Conclusion


#### Let's Review

With a partner, draft a one sentence answer to each of these questions:
- Question 1?
- Question 2?
- Question 3?
