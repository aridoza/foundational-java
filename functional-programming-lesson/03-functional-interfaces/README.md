## Opening (10 min)

Let's dive deeper into Functional Interfaces, which are the heart and soul of lambda expressions. 

To recap, a lambda expression is a concise syntax for expressing an anonymous method.  Remember that syntax for expressing lambda expression is generally as follows:

    (arg1, arg2,...) -> lambda expression body

A Functional Interface is nothing more than an interface with exactly one abstract method. And so I will let you in on a secret... a Lambda expression is syntactic sugar for defining the implementation of a functional interface, by supplying the arguments and the implementation, and skipping all of the boiler plate code of having to say `public void blah(args) { implementation}`. So when you provide a Lambda expression somewhere, what you are really doing is subclassing that abstract class, and providing the implementation for that one abstract method. 

This is important, so let's let it sink in. You should find the rest of this section straightforward, so let's discuss it a bit.

- How does Java know which functional interface you are overriding if you don't specify it? 
        - Answer - The name of the functional interface is specified in the method signature, so Java uses that!
        
- How does Java know which method to override if you are not supplying a method name? 
        - Answer - since there is exactly one abstract method in the functional interface, that is the one Java overrides! 

Let's start by learning how to create your own functional interfaces.

-----

## Functional Interfaces Deep Dive (15 min)

**What is a functional interface?**  

As we said, a functional interface is an interface that contains only exactly abstract method. When writing these interfaces, you should annotate them with the optional @FunctionalInterface annotation. If you don't, the code will still work. But adding the annotation is defensive, and signals the compiler to fail the build, in case anyone someday accidentally adds new abstract methods to the interface.

For example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    ...
}
```

**Why use a functional interface?** Functional interfaces make Lambda expressions possible. Using a functional interface lets us leverage lambda expressions to represent them, instead of having to explicitly subclass them. This is considerably less verbose than creating anonymous inner classes. Let's go through the demo to see some examples.

One other major difference that you may never notice is that the compiler assigns a funny name for every anonymous inner class, whereas lambdas do not.  If you look at your generated classes, you can recognize these files because they have a $ sign and a number following the parent class name, for example `MyClass$21.class`.

**What is a method reference?**  As if lambdas were not concise enough, there are times when you can simplify them even further! When the body of a lambda expression does nothing but call a method using the input parameter as an argument, you can refer to the existing method by name, eliminate the call parameters and the arrow, use the special `::` notation, and the input is understood. 

For example, the following lambda calls one method, System.out.println() on the input parameter:

`param -> System.out.println(param)`

This can be replaced with a method reference, as follows. (Notice the use of the :: to represent the method reference syntax): 

`System.out::println`

Using this syntax, you can see how we eliminated the input parameter, the arrow, and the method argument, by simply using the method name.

### Demo - Functional Interfaces

For this demo, we will be using a few different functional interface examples so that you can get comfortable with them. 

### Example 1 - A functional interface that has no input and returns void.

Given the following functional interface, we can use it to print "Hello World!"

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Greeter {
        public void greet();
    }

    //Use the Greeter to say Hello.
    Greeter greetTheWorld = () -> System.out.println("Hello World!");
    greetTheWorld.greet();
    
Output:  
    Hello World!

Taking a look at the interface... It has only one abstract method, which meets the criteria of a functional interface.  You'll notice that it's also annotated with the optional @FunctionalInteface annotation.

To use the functional interface, we created variable _greetTheWorld_ of type Greeter, and assigned it a lambda expression that takes no arguments, prints out "Hello World!", and returns void. Guess what, that is exactly the signature of the abstract _greet_ method in our functional interface - it takes not parameters and returns void.

The last thing we did was call the greet method for it to execute.

### Example 2 - A functional interface that takes in one input and returns void

Given the following functional interface, it will greet a person based on a given name:

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface GreetByName {
        public void greet(String name);
    }

    GreetByName greetSomeone =
            (name -> System.out.println("Hello " + name + "!  How are you doing today?"));
            
    greetSomeone.greet("Mark");

Output:  
    Hello Mark! How are you doing today?

If you look at the _greet_ method of the _GreetByName_ functional interface,  you'll notice that it takes one String parameter called "name".  This parameter will become the input parameter to the lambda expression that is used further down in the example.  In this case, the lambda input parameter is called "name".  The parameter names don't have to match, but it is a good practice to name them according to what they are.

### Example 3 - A functional interface that has one input and produces one output

The following example uses a functional interface to take an integer input parameter, and output the square of that given input.

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface SquareMe {
        public Integer square(Integer input);
    }

    SquareMe squareMe = (number) -> number * number;
    System.out.println("The square of 11 is " + squareMe.square(11));

Output:  
    The square of 11 is 121

Similar to example 2, the functional interface method "square" takes in one input called "input".  However, this time the "square" method returns an integer.  If you look at the lambda expression, the input parameter "number" matches up to the "input" parameter of the "square" method. The body of the lambda expression will take the input and multiply it by itself.

To get the output, you have to call the "square" method on the "squareMe" variable. ie.

    squareMe.square(11)

----

## Function (10 min)

Java was nice enough to provide us with a robust supply of built-in functional interfaces that should meet a majority of our needs. In the next few sections we'll discuss some of these built in functional interfaces, starting with Function.  

_Function_ is a built-in functional interface that has one abstract method, "apply", which accepts one input and produces one output. 

The Functional Interface for the _Function_ interface looks like:

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Function<T, R> {

        R apply(T t);

        ...
    }

Usage of a Function is:

    Function<T, R> functionVariable = (T arg) -> lambda body that returns the R type

- T is the input argument of a type specified
- R is the return of the function of a specified type. Let's check out the demo to see it in action.

**Key abstract method:**
- apply - this triggers the Function to execute the lambda expression body.

> Check: With a partner, compare and contrast the SquareMe functional interface in Example 3 with the Function interface here.  The SquareMe's abstract method is called "square", whereas the Function abstract method is called "apply".  Even though the method names are different, the SquareMe interface could be replaced with a built-in Function and create the same results.

### Demo - Function

Let's take a look at a couple of examples of how to use _Function_.

The first example will take in a String that represents a name and the output will be a greeting.

    //Create a greeting function
    Function<String, String> greetingFunction = s -> "Good Morning " + s + "!";
    String greeting = greetingFunction.apply("Kyle");
    System.out.println(greeting);

Output:  
    Good Morning Kyle!

Let's talk about what's going on with this example. 

Let's examine the first line:

    Function<String, String> greetingFunction = s -> "Good Morning " + s + "!";

`Function<String, String>` is how we express our Function using generics.  The first String represents the type of the input.  The second String represents the type of the output.

Looking at the lambda expression, the "s" input parameter in our example will be of type String which coincides with the first String of the Function generic.  The lambda body will return a string as well, which coincides with the second String of the Function generic.

Let's look at the 2nd line:  

    String greeting = greetingFunction.apply("Kyle");

The "apply" method is what executes the defined lambda expression and returns the result to the "greeting" variable.

### Why is this useful?

Now we know that Java supplies all of these pre-built functional interfaces, and we see that they are kind of elegant, but how do they add value?

Well, the good news is, you can start using them immediately, without even knowing their names. How? Well, by supplying Lambdas! Since Lambdas don't care about the name of the functional interface, you can use them when the semantics are clear, even if you don't know the function name at all!

For example, the Stream class has a method called _map_.

Specifically:

    <R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper);

Now what this cryptic declaration means is actually something very simple - it means that Streams have a _map_ method, that accept a _Function_ parameter, that returns another Stream. That is why we can say something like:

        List<String> concatenatedList =
            stringList.stream()
                .map(s -> "Hello, " + s)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

The lambda their in the .map method is: 

    s->"Hello, " + s
    
The variable _s_ is the input parameter in the _Function.apply() method_, and the Lambda body _"Hello, " + s_ is the output result of the Function.apply() method. So there, you called the map method without ever having to know you were supplying an implementation for the Function.apply() method.

------

## Supplier (10 min)

Supplier is a built-in functional interface that accepts no inputs and produces a generic output. 

The Functional Interface for the _Supplier_ interface looks like:

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Supplier<T> {

        T get();
    }

Usage of a Supplier is:
 
    Supplier<T> functionVariable = () -> lambda body that returns the T type

- T is the return of the function of a specified type

**Key Methods:**
- get - this will trigger execution of the lambda body

**A Good Supplier Strategy** 

Suppliers are especially valuable in situations that may be expensive to run, even though they might not even be used! Suppliers leverage lazy evaluation, meaning they won't execute until actually needed.  You can use that to your advantage to avoid making the expensive method unless and until it's absolutely need.

### Demo - Supplier

The following demo shows an example of using a Supplier to save you from running an expensive operation when it's not necessary.  

Let's say you have the following:

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Let's see an example without the supplier when calling an expensive operation.
        String doTheyMatch =
                eagerMatch(expensiveComputeOperation("bb"),    
                           expensiveComputeOperation("aa"));
        System.out.println(doTheyMatch);
    }

    private static String eagerMatch(boolean b1, boolean b2) {
        return b1 && b2 ? "match" : "incompatible!";
    }

    private static boolean expensiveComputeOperation(String input) {
        System.out.println("executing expensive computation...");
        // expensive computation here
        return input.contains("a");
    }

Output:  
    executing expensive computation...  
    executing expensive computation...  
    incompatible!  

As you can see, the expensiveComputeOperation is called twice.  Even though the "bb" parameter returns false, the "aa" operation still runs when it doesn't need to.  Now let's look at how you could avoid that by using Suppliers.

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Let's use a supplier.
        doTheyMatch = lazyMatch(() -> expensiveComputeOperation("bb"), () -> expensiveComputeOperation("aa"));
        System.out.println(doTheyMatch);
    }

    private static boolean expensiveComputeOperation(String input) {
        System.out.println("executing expensive computation...");
        // expensive computation here
        return input.contains("a");
    }

    private static String lazyMatch(Supplier<Boolean> a, Supplier<Boolean> b) {
        return a.get() && b.get() ? "match" : "incompatible!";
    }

Output:  
    executing expensive computation...  
    incompatible!  

Since we are now wrapping the expensiveComputeOperation with a Supplier, we now have the ability to run that method only if and when it is needed. Since a.get() in the lazyMatch method returns false, the b.get() will never execute.  This saves us from running the expensiveComputeOperation method when it's not needed.

-------

## Consumer (10 min)

Consumer is a built-in functional interface that accepts one input and has no output. 

The Functional Interface for the _Consumer_ interface looks like:

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Consumer<T> {
        void accept(T t);
    }

Usage of a Consumer is:

    Consumer<T> functionVariable = (T arg) -> lambda body that has no return (void)

- T is the input argument of a specified type

**Key Methods:**
- accept - this triggers execute of the lambda body.

### Demo - Consumer

Let's take a look at a couple of examples of using Consumer. The following example will say Hello to a passed in String.

    Consumer<String> sayHello = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    sayHello.accept("John");

Output:  
    Hello John

As you can see the lambda expression takes in 1 argument "name".  The lambda body return no output. It simply prints out "Hello John".  

The next example takes a list of names and iterates the list and prints out the names using a method reference.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Lisa", "Amanda", "Matt");
        Consumer<String> printNames = ConsumerExamples::printNames;
        names.stream().forEach(name -> printNames.accept(name));
    }

    private static void printNames(String name) {
        System.out.println(name);
    }

Output:  
    John  
    Lisa  
    Amanda  
    Matt  

If you look at the Consumer variable, you'll notice "ConsumerExamples::printNames".  This is what's called a *method reference*.  What this means is that if a method adheres to the contract of a functional interface, you can use the method instead of creating your own lambda expression. If you look at the printNames method, it takes in only 1 input and it produces no output (void).

## Independent Practice (20 min)

For the Independent Practice, we will make use of some of the built-in functional references that you have learned.

**Hint:**

You will need to use:
- Function
- apply
- method references
- forEach

### Independent Practice Template

    package com.ga;

    import java.util.Arrays;
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.stream.Stream;

    public class IndependentPractice {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            List<Integer> list1 = Arrays.asList(1,3,4,5,6);
            List<Integer> list2 = Arrays.asList(1,3,4,5,6);

            //Write a BiFunction that compares to see if list1 and list2 are equal.

            //Rewrite the previous example to leverage a method reference on the Integer class

            List<Integer> numberList = Arrays.asList(4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81);

            //Write a Function that will return the square of a given number.  Then iterate
            //the numberList and print out the results.

        }
    }

------

## Conclusion (10 min)

To recap, we've learned: 
- How to create our own custom functional interfaces
- We've learned what a method reference is
- We've learned about some of the useful built-in functional interfaces

As we wrap up, discuss the following two questions with a partner:
- If I needed a built-in functional interface that provided a method that could take 2 inputs and give me one output, what would I use?
- If I needed a built-in functional interface that provided a method that didn't have input but gave me one output, what would I use?
