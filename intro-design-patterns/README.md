## Introduction (30 min)

In this exercise, we'll learn the basics of design patterns, the underlying rules and customs that define how we build a lot of software. It's an admittedly heady concept, so let's try to make it as simple as possible.

### What's a Design Pattern, Anyway?

To start, let's work through the [myGA lesson on Design Patterns](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/134?assignmentUuid=d5b43f0e-7d2c-4173-afef-8a2e4073e5c6). Take 15-20 minutes to complete the lesson.

When you're done, let's recap:
- Explain it to me like I'm 5: What's a design pattern?
- How do design patterns compare to the frameworks and structures we use as developers?
- What are the three categories of design patterns?
- What questions do you still have?

## Exploring the Patterns (30 min)

Let's look at some of the most famous patterns and see how they work.

Let's get into pairs. Choose one of the following design patterns to research. You should answer the questions:
- How does this design pattern work?
- Why do we use it? What benefits does it provide?
- What does it look like in Java?

**Pattern inventory:**
- MVC
- Singleton
- Decorator
- Factory
- Observer

Take 10 minutes to do some research. Come prepared to share your findings back with the class.
