## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept that was introduced around 1962 with the advent of the Simula programming language, and became popular some 25 years later in C++.

Where earlier languages were _procedural_ in nature, Object Oriented Programming introduced the concept of _Objects_, which were compartments of data and functionality that could easily retain and modify their own instance data. 

## Background on classes
Before Object Oriented programming came along, languages like the C programming language sported a feature called `structs` - a way of defining a common format to allocate blocks of consistent data types.
 
 For example you could say:
 ```java
 struct Person { 
    double birthdate;
    int id, 
    char name[50] 
```
That would basically allow you to carve out memory for all of the structure's variables (e.g. birthdate, id, name) simply by assigning a new struct!

Now, once we have data as a struct, why not add _functionality_ to that structure (e.g., derive a person's age given today's date), and include that inside the struct itself. Well guess what, that is exactly what a class is, a data structure with functions (correction  - "methods"!)

### Defining a class
We've already seen several examples of classes. They all conform to the common pattern:
```java
public class MyClass {
    // guts of the class
}
```
In this example, _public_ is the visibility. Top-level classes can only be public or default (unspecified). Top-level means that they are not inner classes, and we will define inner classes later in this lesson.)

_public_ classes (lower case p) can be referenced by any other class, and this is the most common class visibility. As we saw earlier, a file may contain _no more than one_ public class. The rule is that every top level public Java class must reside in a file that exactly matches the file name (minus the .java file type). (Inner classes don't have that restriction, and can be given any valid Java name, as we will see later.)

Default classes are classes that don't specify a visibility, eg:
```java
class MyDefaultClass {}
```

Default classes can be accessed in the current file, as well as by other classes in the same package.

Those are the only options for top level classes, but as we will see, inner classes can also be protected or private.



### Todo potential topics:
#### calling the super constructor. 
#### implicitly calling the default super constructor
~~Inheritance (included in subclasses lesson)~~
~~Polymorphism (included in subclasses lesson~~
~~Encapsulation (included in subclasses lesson)~~
### scope
### Difference between instance variables, class variables and method variables
#### equals
#### hashCode
#### toString
~~Interfaces (see lessons above)~~
~~Abstract classes (see lessons above)~~
### Static members (Already handled static methods. Do we still need this rubric?)
### Member visibility
~~Singleton (see lessons above)~~
~~Inner classes (won't do, see note above): Inner classes are classes that are nested inside of other classes. Even though we said a file may contain only one top level public class, it may contain inner classes as well, which are members of its parent class) So in our case, public class HelloWorld is the only public class defined in the file HelloWorld.java. (On the other hand, a file is not required to have any public classes.)~~
### ~~Static Inner classes~~
### ~~Anonymous Inner classes~~
### Overloaded methods (and constructors) / can't have same signature
### Overriding methods (and constructors)

An automobile
--- Difference between procedural, functional, object oriented programming
SOLID 
OOP & Java Syntax (i.e., the basics of Java, continued)
Concept: Objects & Relationships between them
Methods and Classes, 
Classes vs Objects / Instantiation
Constructors
Method Calls 
Method arguments
Concept: Internal State
Instance Variables
Primitives vs References
Encapsulation and Information Hiding
Basic Java Data Types  – String and int 
setters/getters
Concept: Reuse 
--- Inheritance “is a” vs Composition “has a” - composition is generally preferable. Unlike C++, Java only allows you to inherit from 1 class at a time. Additionally, the super class can have methods that apply to some subclasses but not to others. It might be tempting to move these methods into a new abstract class but then you end up with the same problem of inheriting from multiple classes. Interfaces help address these issues. Create an interface for each behavior and have classes implement them in a way specific to that class. 
Interfaces
--- Default method implementations in interfaces
--- Abstract classes and methods
Polymorphism and overriding
--- Single inheritance, multiple interfaces (instead of multiple inheritance)
--- Programming to an interface not an implementation
Scope and Modifier (keywords and what they mean) 
default
public
private
protected
static
final
volatile (advanced)
transient (advanced)
--- Annotations
--- How annotations work in Java
--- Byte code and compilers
--- Core Java annotations
--- @Override
--- @Deprecated
--- @FunctionalInterface (bonus)
